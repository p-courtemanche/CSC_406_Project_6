 * 	require access to this information just need to
 * 	"implement ApplicationConstants".
 * 
 * 	All calculations are made for a world reference frame with axes
 * 	parallel to that of the window:
 * 		- x axis horizontal and pointing to the right of the window
 * 		- y axis vertical and pointing up in the window. 
 * 	 
 * 	This is the version we did in class, somewhat cleaned up,
 * 	with javadoc comments for documentation, and some regular
 * 	comments to attract your attention to features and weaknesses.
 * 
 * 	In this version of the interface, we set the dimensions (width and height)
 * 	of the window (in pixels) and the bounds of the world (XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX
 *  in world units).  All the scales, conversion factors, and location of the 
 *  world's origin relative to the window (in pixels) are calculated from these 6 values.
